US stocks ended mixed on Monday to start a week that will include the heavily-anticipated CPI and PPI numbers.

Stocks were largely range bound, but as Mary Chapin Carpenter sings in House of Cards “on the surface it looked so safe but it was perilous underneath.”

Even though the major stock indexes barely budged, it was another rough day for bank stocks as the KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index was off almost 3% yesterday. In addition, the Fed’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices indicated that credit conditions worsened in Q1.

The Dow fell 56 points (0.17%) yesterday but the broader indexes posted modest gains. The S&P 500 inched up 0.05% and the Nasdaq advanced 0.18%.

Treasury yields moved higher again on Monday. The yield on the two-year moved up eight basis points to 4.00% while the yield on the 10-year also rose eight basis points to 3.52%.

CMBS trading was light again on Monday as about $100 million was out for bid. Last cashflow conduit AAA spreads were unchanged and BBB- spreads were unchanged to six basis points wider.

CMBX 8-16 AAA spreads were flat to a basis point wider. CMBX 8-16 BBB- spreads came in between 12 and 25 basis points.

US stocks rallied again on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday’s heavily anticipated CPI number.

The Dow climbed another 317 points (0.93%) yesterday as that index is now up more than 500 points over the last two days. The S&P 500 advanced 0.67% and the Nasdaq gained 0.55%.

On the data front, the Small Business Optimism Index from the National Federation of Independent Business for June came in above expectations.

Treasuries were mixed on Tuesday as the curve became slightly more inverted. The yield on the two-year moved up three basis points to 4.88% while the yield on the 10-year fell two basis points to 3.99%.

CMBS trading was moderate again on Tuesday as about $160 million was out for bid. Last cashflow AAA conduit spreads tightened one basis point and BBB- spreads came in 10 bps.

CMBX 8-16 AAA spreads tightened by up to two basis points. Meanwhile, CMBX 8-16 BBB- spreads came in sharply with spreads tightening between 14 and 35 basis points.

US stocks took off Wednesday morning after a cooler-than-expected CPI print immediately unleashed investors’ animal spirits. Those gains would be pared as the day progressed, but the major indexes still ended the day firmly in the black, with tech stocks leading the way.

It was also a good day for banks with shares of regional banks rallying yesterday.

Yesterday’s CPI number – which represented the 12th consecutive decline – also sent Treasury yields sharply lower on Wednesday. As with stocks, Treasury yields moved quickly after the CPI print.

CMBX spreads also dropped dramatically yesterday – more on that below. Between the falling bond yields and lower hedging costs, could an uptick in CMBS lending and issuance be on the way?

The Dow advanced 86 points (0.25%) on Wednesday while the S&P 500 gained 0.74% and the Nasdaq climbed 1.15%.

Meanwhile, the yield on the two-year dropped 16 basis points to 4.72% while the yield on the 10-year fell 13 basis points to 3.86%.

CMBS trading was light on Wednesday as only about $75 million was out for bid.

It has been a terrific week already for lower-rated CMBS bonds and that trend accelerated yesterday.

AAA conduit spreads tightened by one or two basis points but the big news came from the BBB- market where the spread came in 20 to 25 basis points. (Combined with tumbling Treasury yields, that made for some big price moves yesterday.)

CMBX 8-16 AAA spreads again tightened by one or two basis points while CMBX 8-16 BBB- spreads dropped between 30 and 70 basis points.

If the trend continues, the winds would become much more favorable for CMBS lenders in the near future.
