US stocks ended mixed on Monday to start a week that will include the heavily-anticipated CPI and PPI numbers.

Stocks were largely range bound, but as Mary Chapin Carpenter sings in House of Cards “on the surface it looked so safe but it was perilous underneath.”

Even though the major stock indexes barely budged, it was another rough day for bank stocks as the KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index was off almost 3% yesterday. In addition, the Fed’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices indicated that credit conditions worsened in Q1.

The Dow fell 56 points (0.17%) yesterday but the broader indexes posted modest gains. The S&P 500 inched up 0.05% and the Nasdaq advanced 0.18%.

Treasury yields moved higher again on Monday. The yield on the two-year moved up eight basis points to 4.00% while the yield on the 10-year also rose eight basis points to 3.52%.

CMBS trading was light again on Monday as about $100 million was out for bid. Last cashflow conduit AAA spreads were unchanged and BBB- spreads were unchanged to six basis points wider.

CMBX 8-16 AAA spreads were flat to a basis point wider. CMBX 8-16 BBB- spreads came in between 12 and 25 basis points.
